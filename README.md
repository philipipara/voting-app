# voting-app

I decided with all of the arguing going on about mail-in votes to create a quick mockup of holding an election online. I wanted to show my friends how someone can quickly throw up a website to handle this. We are in a technical revolution yet still relying on voting on paper. I of course have my theories as to why we do not go online with elections, but created this nonetheless to give people an idea of how we could transition to online voting. It is a simple React app that the home page brings you to the Presidents and cannot vote unless logged in.
